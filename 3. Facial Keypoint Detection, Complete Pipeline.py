# ## Face and Facial Keypoint detection
# 
# After you've trained a neural network to detect facial keypoints, you can then apply this network to *any* image that includes faces. The neural network expects a Tensor of a certain size as input and, so, to detect any face, you'll first have to do some pre-processing.
# 
# 1. Detect all the faces in an image using a face detector (we'll be using a Haar Cascade detector in this notebook).
# 2. Pre-process those face images so that they are grayscale, and transformed to a Tensor of the input size that your net expects. This step will be similar to the `data_transform` you created and applied in Notebook 2, whose job was tp rescale, normalize, and turn any iimage into a Tensor to be accepted as input to your CNN.
# 3. Use your trained model to detect facial keypoints on the image.

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.image as mpimg
get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')


# #### Select an image 
# 
# Select an image to perform facial keypoint detection on; you can select any image of faces in the `images/` directory.

# In[2]:


import cv2
# load in color image for face detection
image = cv2.imread('images/obamas.jpg')

# switch red and blue color channels 
# --> by default OpenCV assumes BLUE comes first, not RED as in many images
image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

# plot the image
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(9,9))
plt.imshow(image)


# ## Detect all faces in an image
# 
# Next, you'll use one of OpenCV's pre-trained Haar Cascade classifiers, all of which can be found in the `detector_architectures/` directory, to find any faces in your selected image.
# 
# In the code below, we loop over each face in the original image and draw a red square on each face (in a copy of the original image, so as not to modify the original). You can even [add eye detections](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.1/d7/d8b/tutorial_py_face_detection.html) as an *optional* exercise in using Haar detectors.
# 
# An example of face detection on a variety of images is shown below.
# 
# <img src='images/haar_cascade_ex.png' width=80% height=80%/>
# 

# In[3]:


# load in a haar cascade classifier for detecting frontal faces
face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('detector_architectures/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')

# run the detector
# the output here is an array of detections; the corners of each detection box
# if necessary, modify these parameters until you successfully identify every face in a given image
faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(image, 1.2, 2)

# make a copy of the original image to plot detections on
image_with_detections = image.copy()

# loop over the detected faces, mark the image where each face is found
for (x,y,w,h) in faces:
    # draw a rectangle around each detected face
    # you may also need to change the width of the rectangle drawn depending on image resolution
    cv2.rectangle(image_with_detections,(x,y),(x+w,y+h),(255,0,0),3) 

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(9,9))

plt.imshow(image_with_detections)


# ## Loading in a trained model
# 
# Once you have an image to work with (and, again, you can select any image of faces in the `images/` directory), the next step is to pre-process that image and feed it into your CNN facial keypoint detector.
# 
# First, load your best model by its filename.

# In[4]:


import torch
from models import Net

net = Net()

## TODO: load the best saved model parameters (by your path name)
## You'll need to un-comment the line below and add the correct name for *your* saved model
net.load_state_dict(torch.load('saved_models/keypoints_model_25_epochs.pt'))

## print out your net and prepare it for testing (uncomment the line below)
net.eval()


# ## Keypoint detection
# 
# Now, we'll loop over each detected face in an image (again!) only this time, you'll transform those faces in Tensors that your CNN can accept as input images.
# 
# ### TODO: Transform each detected face into an input Tensor
# 
# You'll need to perform the following steps for each detected face:
# 1. Convert the face from RGB to grayscale
# 2. Normalize the grayscale image so that its color range falls in [0,1] instead of [0,255]
# 3. Rescale the detected face to be the expected square size for your CNN (224x224, suggested)
# 4. Reshape the numpy image into a torch image.
# 
# **Hint**: The sizes of faces detected by a Haar detector and the faces your network has been trained on are of different sizes. If you find that your model is generating keypoints that are too small for a given face, try adding some padding to the detected `roi` before giving it as input to your model.
# 
# You may find it useful to consult to transformation code in `data_load.py` to help you perform these processing steps.
# 
# 
# ### TODO: Detect and display the predicted keypoints
# 
# After each face has been appropriately converted into an input Tensor for your network to see as input, you can apply your `net` to each face. The ouput should be the predicted the facial keypoints. These keypoints will need to be "un-normalized" for display, and you may find it helpful to write a helper function like `show_keypoints`. You should end up with an image like the following with facial keypoints that closely match the facial features on each individual face:
